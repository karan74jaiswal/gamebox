 * worldLandmarks and in pixels in the image; the ratio through the camera's
 * focal length gives distance. The image position is then unprojected through
 * the same camera the scene renders with, so the effect registers with the
 * video.

 * the palm and `tangent` runs wrist -> middle knuckle. Together they let the

 * silhouette lands on the finger's pixels whatever depth it is given. Lateral
 * registration with the video is exact by construction. Depth is the anchor's
 * estimate plus the joint's metric offset from the palm plane (from the world
 * landmarks), minus a forward bias that grows toward the tip: MediaPipe
 * under-reports how far a curling finger has come toward the lens, and the
 * bias is what lets a shallow cup be enough to wrap the ball.
 *
 * Sign: MediaPipe world +z is AWAY from the camera, the scene camera looks down
 * -Z, so a joint with larger world z gets a larger depth and lands farther
 * away. A fingertip curling toward the lens has world z below the palm plane,
 * dz < 0, and comes nearer. The bias subtracts, and also comes nearer.
 *
 * Returned as OFFSETS from `pose.position`, so the caller adds them to the
 * ball's smoothed, velocity-predicted anchor: proxy and ball then share one
 * smoothing and one prediction and cannot desync sideways.
