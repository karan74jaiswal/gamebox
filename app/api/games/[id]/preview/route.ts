/**
 * The url a game's preview iframe loads.
 *
 * The preview panel calls this on mount, so it is also what brings the game's
 * server up: `startGameServer` reuses whatever is already running, and only
 * pays the start-up cost on the first load after a sandbox has gone idle.
 *
 * The url is signed rather than the standard token-authenticated preview link,
 * because it is loaded in an iframe, which cannot send the
 * `x-daytona-preview-token` header the standard link requires.
 *
 * `getGame` resolves the organization from the session and scopes the lookup to
 * it, so a game belonging to another org — or a caller with no session at all —
 * is indistinguishable from a game that doesn't exist.
